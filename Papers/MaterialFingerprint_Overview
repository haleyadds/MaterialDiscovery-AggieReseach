This paper looks at how to create a representation of a material that can be used to uniquely identify
each material and also should help identify materials that are similar to each other.  It then uses these
material ‘fingerprints’ to try and identify materials that should be similar to each other. We are not
interested in the B-fingerprint or D-fingerprint pieces, which are about the electronic structure 
(information we do not have access to for our predictions). Instead we are interested in the SiRMS descriptors,
which describes the local structure and chemical nature of the material.
