This paper is on constructing potentials to be used in molecular dynamics from density
functional calculations. We are not interested in this part. The more interesting part for
us is how they represent the physical structure of the materials using symmetry
functions. This is discussed starting on the second page on the left side. These symmetry
functions describe the local structure around each atom and could be combined with
other information to give some physical representation of the material. I think there are 
better papers that descirbe these functions more, but I could not find them right away. I
will look for them.
