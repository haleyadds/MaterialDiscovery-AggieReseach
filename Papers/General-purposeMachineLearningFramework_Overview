This paper is a good look at machine learning in material science from the atomic level.
It goes through a couple of cases of actually using these machine learning algorithms to
predict physical properties for some materials. What we are more interested in is the
attributes that they have created, which is a rather extensive list. We can use these as a
starting point for some properties of the materials that could be used for prediction
purposes. The attributes are laid out in more detail in the supplementary materials, found
